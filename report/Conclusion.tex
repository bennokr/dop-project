\section{Conclusion}
%Discussion, future work

%Split (held-out est) reduces bias towards large fragments


%Double-DOP: best performance

%Performance not correlated with consistency of the method

%Shortest derivation, very short grammar. But not as useful as it would seem: bad performance

\paragraph{Future work}
% analysis of other DOP grammars, 
%more elaborate analysis: possibly clustering on features such as depth, number of substitution sites and terminals

% is consistency indeed a valuable property at all?
