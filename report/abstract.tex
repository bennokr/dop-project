This paper investigates two existing estimators in the Data Oriented Parsing approach to natural language syntax: \ddop{} and \dops. We assess the theoretical and practical differences between these estimators by comparing the grammars they derive and their performance on the WSJ treebank. % /part of
Performing estimation with a split corpus decreased the weight of large fragments, and the consistent estimator did not perform better than the non-consistent estimators.
We elucidate the correspondence between the grammar distributions and their theoretical properties.
