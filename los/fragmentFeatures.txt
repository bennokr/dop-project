Features of a fragment:

A - Depth
B - Root node
C - Number of nodes (internal, external)
D - Occurrence of terminals
E - Weight according to Max-overlap
F - Weight according to shortest-der
G - Difference between E and F (is this predictable from the features? i.e. usable for regression?)


Visualization: Sort by difference in assigned weight? 
Scatterplot with E and F along the axes (possibly also: depth color, shape root)

NB binarization: when? And transformation to PCFG rules for parser?
